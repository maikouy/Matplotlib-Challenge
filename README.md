Matplotlib-Challenge


Python Matplotlib to analyze the animal study of 259 mice identified with squarmous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor growth with a variety of drug regimens. The dataset consists of observation and measurements for 45 days. The purpose of the study is to compare the performance of Capomulin, the drug of interest, versus the other treatment regimens.   

Thus, create a Python Matplotlib analyzation consisting of tables and figures of:

-A summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen

-A bar plot using Pandas’ Dataframe & Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen throughout the study

-A pie plot using Pandas’ Dataframe & Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study

-Calculate the final tumor volume for the 4 treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and any outliers.

-A box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all 4 treatment regimens and highlight any outliers, if any.

-Select a mouse that was treated by Capomulin and generate a line plot of tumor volume vs time point.

-A scatter plot of tumor volume vs mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

-Calculate the correlation coefficient and liner regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.
